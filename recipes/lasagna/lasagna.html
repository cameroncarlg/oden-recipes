    <p>
      Lasagna is a savory Italian dish renowned for its delectable layers of
      wide, flat pasta sheets, interleaved with rich, hearty tomato sauce,
      creamy béchamel sauce, and a flavorful blend of cheeses, typically
      mozzarella, ricotta, and Parmesan. This layered masterpiece is often
      interspersed with finely seasoned ground meat, such as beef or pork, and
      occasionally includes vegetables like spinach or mushrooms, creating a
      harmonious symphony of tastes and textures. The entire ensemble is baked
      to perfection, resulting in a golden-brown top layer that adds a
      satisfying crunch to each luscious, mouthwatering bite.
